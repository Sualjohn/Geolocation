# Geolocation
Find coordinates and the driving distances between locations using Python, Pandas, and the Google Maps API

The goal of this code is to import a csv or Excel file and add the latitude, longitude, and driving distance between origin and destination to the dataframe. 
The file should contain at least a column with origin address data and one with destination address data. 
In the sample data, both the origin and destination contain a column for country, city, and postal code.
